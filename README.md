# Software Developer Developer Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for prospective Software Developer/Full Stack Developer/Backend Developer applicants applying through http://work.traderev.com/

## Goal:

#### This is to build part of a simple Car Auction System which will allow users to bid on Cars for sale.

- [ ] Fork this repo. Keep it public until we have been able to review it.
- [ ] Use the language that you feel you are the strongest
- [ ] Auction last x minutes
- [ ] Able to record a user's bid when auction is alive, and keep history of all the bids
- [ ] Current winning bid on a Car
- [ ] You are not require to implement a GUI but a GUI is a bonus.

### Evaluation:
Your application will be reviewed by our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

We value quality over feature-completeness. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The code should be as close to production-ready as possible

The aspects of your code we will assess include:
- [ ] Correctness: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- [ ] Architecture: does the application handle requests and data efficiently? Is the code structured in a reusable and easily adaptable way?
- [ ] Code quality: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- [ ] Testing: do you have some unit and some integration tests?
- [ ] Technical choices: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?
