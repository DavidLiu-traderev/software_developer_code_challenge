# Software Developer Developer Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for prospective Software Developer/Full Stack Developer/Backend Developer applicants applying through http://work.traderev.com/

# Simple Online Car Auction System
## Goal: You have been tasked with building part of a simple online auction system which will allow users to bid on cars for sale.

#### Provide a bid tracker interface and concrete implementation with the following functionality:
- [ ] Fork this repo. Keep it public until we have been able to review it.

- [ ] Record a user's bid on a car
- [ ] Get the current winning bid for a car
- [ ] Get all the bids for a car
- [ ] Get all the cars on which a user has bid

Bouns:
- [ ] Unit Tests on the above functions
- [ ] GUI (or CLI) or persistent storage.


You may use any appropriate libraries to help.Â Use the language that you feel you are the strongest


### Evaluation:
Your application will be reviewed by our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

We value quality over feature-completeness. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. If you are invited for an on-site interview, we will go through your solution together with you so that you can explain the thoughts behind your technological, tooling, architectural and algorithmic decisions.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:
- [ ] Correctness: does the function do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- [ ] Architecture: Deign of the functions. Is the code structured in a reusable and easily adaptable way?
- [ ] Code quality: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- [ ] Testing: do you have some unit and some integration tests?
- [ ] Technical choices: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?
